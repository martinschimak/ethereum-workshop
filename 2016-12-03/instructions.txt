TODO:

in a shell go into att

> npm install

> npm install -g dapple

dapple *must* be installed globally. if you installed it locally by mistake delete dapple from node_modules

> npm run test

output from mocha section should include: '8 passing'
output from dapple section should end with: 'Passed all 7 tests!'

if it doesn't work, make sure there is no solc in your PATH




commands for later:

geth --dev --rpc
